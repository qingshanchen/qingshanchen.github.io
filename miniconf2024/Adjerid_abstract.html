<h1>
Nonlinear-feedback control for stokes type DAEs
</h1>

Abstract:
We study optimal feedback control for a class of
differential algebraic equations (DAEs) with quadratic non-
linearity. Systems of this specific form would arise in the
discretization of control problems associated with the Navier-
Stokes equations, but here we focus our attention on finite
dimensional systems with this form. Our approach is to use
the strangeness framework to appropriately recast the DAEs as
systems of differential equations with polynomial drift terms. At
this stage it is appropriate to develop standard approximations
to the feedback control laws. We describe this process and
note the differences in implementation to other approaches
that rely on projections (which can destroy sparsity in the
original DAEs). To simplify the exposition, we describe the
optimal control for cases when the control does not appear
in the algebraic constraints though we describe how this can
be generalized.
