Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) have received 
increasing amount of attention recently as they appear in several different 
applications, such as Interest Rate Modeling, Interface Dynamics, Non-linear 
Filtering and so on.  Compared to numerical methods for PDEs, numerical methods 
and the theory for SPDEs are very undeveloped. In this talk, we are going to 
convert Parabolic SPDEs into Backward Doubly Stochastic Differential Equations 
(BDSDEs) and propose a new type of numerical scheme for BDSDEs. Thus we have 
provided a novel numerical scheme for Parabolic SPDEs.
