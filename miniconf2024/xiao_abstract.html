 In this talk, we study an optimal and stable grid-upwind finite volume method for
solving linear
  elliptic equations with Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on rectangular or
cubic mesh. 
  As suggested in the optimal weighted upwind covolume method, our method also uses
the non-standard 
  upwind grids for the control volumes whose vertex positions are automatically
computed from the 
  local Peclet's numbers and may vary a lot in different control volumes of the
primary mesh. On the
  other hand, our discretization basically uses the middle point quadrature and thus
has second order 
  truncation errors locally. Through various numerical experiments and comparisons
in the two and 
  three dimensions, we demonstrate that our method is not only stable but also has
optimal convergence 
  rates even for strongly convection-dominated problems.
