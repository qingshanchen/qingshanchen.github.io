Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ real matrix, if the manifolds ${\cal M}_A=\{
G^{-1}AG|G\in\text{GL}(n,\mathbb R)\}$ and $Q(\text{sgn}(A))$
(consisting of all real matrices having the same sign pattern as $A$),
both considered as embedded submanifolds of $\mathbb R^{n \times n}$,
intersect transversally at $A$, then  every superpattern of sgn$(A)$
also allows a matrix similar to $A$. In this paper, we define this
similarity-transversality property (STP)  as the full row rank
property of the Jacobian matrix of the entries of $AX-XA$ at the zero
entry positions of $A$ with respect to the nondiagonal entries of $X$,
where $X=[x_{ij}]$ is a generic matrix of order $n$ whose entries are
independent variables. This approach makes it possible to take better
advantage of the combinatorial structure of the matrix $A$, and
provides theoretical foundation for constructing matrices similar to a
given matrix while the entries have certain desired signs. In
particular, several important classes of zero-nonzero patterns and
sign patterns that require or allow this transversality property are
identified. We provide some examples to illustrate possible
applications.
