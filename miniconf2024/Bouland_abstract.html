Control of the Fluidic Pinball using the Quadratic-Quadratic Regulator
</h1>

Abstract: In control of fluid dynamics, the fluidic pinball problem presents an important benchmark problem. This problem seeks to control the vortex shedding behind three cylinders using cylinder rotation as the actuation mechanism. This talk describes a new model-based approach combining the Quadratic-Quadratic Regulator (QQR) feedback control methodology with Interpolatory Model Order Reduction (IMOR) to address this challenge. We start with a Finite Element Model of the problem, We will present the formulation and our preliminary results.
