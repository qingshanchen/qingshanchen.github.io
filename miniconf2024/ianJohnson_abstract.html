In this talk I describe our efforts to incorporate a real time fluid solver, using
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) into the game engine of Blender, a powerful
open source framework. We implemented the algorithm on the GPU using OpenCL, an open
standard and portable across a range of devices. I will cover the ideas behind our
method and the issues we encountered working with OpenCL. I will also show a short
demo or video along with benchmark results of our implementation against other
existing CPU and GPU codes.
