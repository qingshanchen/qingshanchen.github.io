We propose an accurate multi-step scheme on time-space grids for solving 
backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). For high accuracy, we 
preprocess the target equation before discretization, changing it from a 
stochastic problem to a deterministic problem. Then, we apply a multi-step 
method in time and the Gauss-Hermite quadrature approximation in space to 
construct the multi-step scheme. Error estimates are rigorously proved for 
the semi-discrete version of the proposed scheme for BSDEs with certain 
type of simplified generator functions. For efficiency, we improve our 
scheme by applying a new kind of random process, called the Gauss-Hermite 
process, by which the time-space domain needed for solving BSDEs at a 
particular point of interest can be significantly compared to the domain 
used by the multi-step scheme. Error estimates are rigorously derived to 
verify that the improved scheme can keep the essentially the same accuracy 
as that of the multi-step scheme. Furthermore, in order to break the curse 
of dimensionality, we apply hierarchical bases and associated sparse grids 
to effect the spatial interpolation. Combining these techniques, high 
dimensional BSDEs can be solved efficiently with acceptable accuracy.
