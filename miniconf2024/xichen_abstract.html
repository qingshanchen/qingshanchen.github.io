Numerical prediction of crack growth and damage are long-standing 
problems 
in compu- tational mechanics. The difficulties inherent in these problems 
arise from the basic incom- patibility of cracks with the partial 
differential equations that are used in the classical theory of solid 
mechanics. The spatial derivatives needed for these partial differential 
equations to make sense do not exist on a crack tip or surface. Therefore, 
any numerical method derived from these equations inherits this difficulty 
in modeling cracks. The peridynamic theory of mechanics attempts to unite 
the mathematical modeling of continuous media, cracks, and particles 
within a single framework. It does this by replacing the partial 
differential equa- tions of the classical theory of solid mechanics with 
integral or integro-differential equations. Theoretical and numerical 
analysis based on the deterministic and stochastic peridynam- ics model 
will be studied, relevant numerical experiments will be conducted to show 
the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
