<h1>
Orthogonal similarity via transversal intersection of manifolds
</h1>

Let $A$ be an  $n\times n$ real matrix. We define orthogonal
similarity-transversality property (OSTP) if the smooth manifold
consisting of  the real matrices orthogonally similar to $A$  and the
smooth manifold $Q(\text{sgn}(A))$ (consisting of all real matrices
having the same sign pattern as $A$), both considered as embedded
smooth submanifolds  of $\mathbb R^{n \times n}$,  intersect
transversally at $A$. More specifically, with  $S=[s_{ij}]$ being the
$n\times n$ generic skew-symmetric matrix whose strictly lower (or
upper) triangular  entries   are regarded as independent free
variables, we say that $A$ has the OSTP if the Jacobian  matrix of the
entries of $AS-SA$ at the zero entry positions of $A$ with respect to
the strictly lower (or upper) triangular entries of $S$ has full row
rank. We also formulate several properties and show that if a matrix
$A$ has the OSTP, then every superpattern of the sign pattern sgn$(A)$
allows a matrix orthogonally similar to $A$, and every matrix
sufficiently close to $A$ also has the OSTP.   This approach provides
a theoretical foundation for constructing matrices orthogonally
similar to a given matrix while the entries have certain desired signs
or zero-nonzero restrictions. In particular, several important classes
of zero-nonzero patterns and sign patterns that require or allow the
OSTP  are identified. We provide several Examples illustrating some
applications.
