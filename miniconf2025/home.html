    <p>
      On September 27-28th, 2025, there will be an informal miniconference
      in applied mathematics and related areas.  We are very excited about the success of this conference, and that we have made it
	to year 12!  
    </p>

    <!--
    <p>
      The conference is sponsored jointly by 
      <a href = "http://people.clemson.edu/~siam/"> Clemson SIAM Student Chapter</a>, by
      <a href = "http://www.siam.org/sections/seas/"> SIAM Southeast </a>, by
      <a href = "http://www.math.clemson.edu/">Clemson Mathematical Sciences Department</a>.
    </p>
    -->

    <p>
      In part, the conference is intended as a "practice session" for
      students, to give them a comfortable forum in which
      to present the results of their research, while getting advice and
      suggestions from their peers and mentors.  This kind of oral presentation
      is a vital part of a graduate student's career.  The talks presented
      at this conference will be developed further for presentation 
      at job interviews and at conferences, such as the regional
      SIAM SEAS conference.
    </p>

    <p>
      The conference is also intended to be an opportunity for
      the beginning researchers to gain exposure for their own work, to get an
      idea of what others are working on, and to meet and to exchange ideas
      with others in their field of interest.
    </p>

    <p>
     We are grateful for the financial support from the National
     Science Foundation.
